The Beginning: Soul Design Coaching

Soul Design Coaching is the product of my spirituality and growth journey. 

Life-coaching was not something I had intended on doing, but after working with my very own life-coach and achieving incredible break-throughs in such a short period of time, I realized that this was something I was gifted to do. 

For over a decade I've been hitting a brick wall. Unsure of what was holding me back. My faith was in tact, my support was solid, my drive was never faltered, but I got nowhere. I pushed so hard to see results, only to be discouraged at every corner. 

As a very spiritual being, I realized that I was fighting an inner struggle. One where I continuously inhibited doing everything I _**wanted**_ to do, and focused all my energy on everything I _should _do. Or what I thought I should be doing anyways. I then hit rock bottom. My health deteriorated badly, I thought I was dying from some unknown disease. This was the last straw, I was getting nowhere in life, but I knew as a physical therapist and personal trainer that nutritionally and physically I was doing everything right. After years of doctors visits and therapy sessions, the conclusion I came to - I was oppressing my true self. Coming to that conclusion, I decided then and there to submit to a Higher Power and stop pushing my self in a direction it refuses to go. 

Instantly my life started changing, opportunities opened up, my life sped up in a way I could never have fathomed. Within days I was on a plane, met pretty much most of my creative idols, spent some intimate time with them, and returned home, quite uncertain what to do next, but convinced that I needed to return to my true self and get back into creating art. This was when I met my life coach. Immediately after our first session my decade long creative block was undone. The year that followed was nothing short of magical. The Universe spoke loud and clear: "This is the path you should be taking."

I walked away from physical therapy and personal training. I walked away from a stable career and stepped into uncertainty. But I haven't looked back ever since.  With the support of my life coach, family and friends, I was encouraged to begin my own life coaching journey. To help others through my experiences. 

The focus here might not be so different from other life coaching services out there. But I do try to focus most on helping others tap into their true self, release any creativity blocks, and unleash strengths that lie within with the goal of leading a more fulfilling and purposeful lifestyle. 

We often underestimate ourselves, but the possibilities to our resilience and abilities is endless, and yet we live very unhappy and unfulfilled lifestyles. I never thought I would be able to change that, but I was able to in a very short period of time. So to show gratitude to what I've been blessed with, I am here to help you achieve your goals and dig deep into yourselves to explore the universe within.
